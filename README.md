# 00 Intro to Python Homework Projects

This folder is part of the [Learn Modern AI Python](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-modern-ai-python) repository by Panaversity. It contains a collection of homework assignments that introduce you to basic Python programming concepts.

## Overview

The projects in this directory are designed to help you learn and practice core Python skills, including:
- Reading user input and displaying output
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Using control structures like loops and conditionals
- Applying basic mathematical formulas (e.g., the Pythagorean theorem)
- Working with standard libraries (such as `math` and `random`)

Each assignment focuses on a specific task or problem, such as converting units, calculating sums, or simulating dice rolls.

## Projects

Some examples of the projects you can find here include:
- **Feet to Inches Converter:** Converts a given measurement in feet to inches.
- **Hypotenuse Calculator:** Uses the Pythagorean theorem to compute the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
- **Energy Calculator:** Uses Einstein's mass-energy equivalence to compute energy.
- **Dice Roll Simulator:** Simulates rolling two dice multiple times.
- **Simple Arithmetic and User Interaction Programs:** Various exercises that introduce fundamental programming concepts.

## How to Run
